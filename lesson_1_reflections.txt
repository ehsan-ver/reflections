How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped me by pointing to the differences between the old and new version of the files.
so instead of reading all the file, I read only the changes and it was easier to find the error.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
it helps tracking the changes that occured at different points.
